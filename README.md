# Book Library for The Odin Project

[Live Demo](https://paposeco.github.io/library/)

This web app lets you keep track of your book collection. There are 6 books as examples of how the titles are displayed. On each book, you can add information on the name of the author, the number the pages and whether or not you have read the book. The collection is saved locally.

## Notes

After looking at other people's projects, I have realized that I once again went for a more whimsical look, instead of a corporate one. It was fun, but on the next project I will try to keep it down.

Otherwise, I am happy with the result.

## Update November 2021

Integrated my Book Library implementation with Firebase. Localstorage still works if the user isn't signed in. Fixed some mistakes I found while reviewing my code, but left it as was for the most part. Today I would have implemented it differently, but I want to kept it as is, as a reminder of how this learning front-end process began.
